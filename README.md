A portfolio of hands-on SQL projects to showcase and demonstrate my coding language skills.

# Charity Carrasquillo's SQL Portfolio 💻✨

Welcome to my SQL project portfolio! This is where I’m storing all the hands-on SQL work I’ve done using Khan Academy and real-world themes that inspire me (like fashion, wellness, and lifestyle). Each `.sql` file represents a unique database I designed, queried, and analyzed.
